# PnPEmployee
. I created a C# application called PnPEmployee Application.
 1. This application will allow you to be able to search for the employees details(By clicking on the employee name or number on the datagrid) 
    that work at PnP as well as add more/new employees that will be working for PnP.
 2. In the next form it is the Update form where you can update the employees Details in case of change or error.
